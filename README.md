Final Burn Alpha for Raspberry Pi
---------------------------------

Final Burn Alpha is a multi-system emulator. This particular port is
essentially the SDL version of the emulator with native GLES-based
rendering for the Raspberry Pi.

Source is based on
[FBA for OpenDingux](https://github.com/dmitrysmagin/fba-sdl), sans the
OpenDingux-specific stuff.

Compiling
---------

To compile from source, run `make pi` and grab a :coffee: - it's going to be a
while.

Quitting
--------

To exit the emulator, press `F12`.

Supported Games
---------------

See [gamelist.txt](gamelist.txt).
